# Text Generation Inference

Text Generation Inference (TGI) is built for deploying and serving Large Language Models (LLMs). TGI enables high-performance text generation using Tensor Parallelism and dynamic batching for the most popular open-source LLMs, including StarCoder, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, Llama, and T5. Text Generation Inference implements many optimizations and features for all supported model architectures, such as:

- Serve the most popular Large Language Models with a simple launcher
- Tensor Parallelism for faster inference on multiple GPUs
- Token streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- [Continuous batching of incoming requests](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/tree/main/router) for increased total throughput
- Optimized transformers code for inference using [flash-attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) and [Paged Attention](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) on the most popular architectures
- Quantization with [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) and [GPT-Q](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323)
- [Safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) weight loading
- Watermarking with [A Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226)
- Logits warper (temperature scaling, top-p, top-k, repetition penalty, more details see [transformers.LogitsProcessor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/generation_utils#transformers.LogitsProcessor))
- Stop sequences
- Log probabilities
- Production ready (distributed tracing with Open Telemetry, Prometheus metrics)
